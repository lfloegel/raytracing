average a bunch of samples inside each pixel 
not bothering with stratification
    critical to some ray tracers 

for given pixel, have multiple samples within pixel 
    send rays through each of the samples 
    colors of rays averaged 

camera class: manages virtual camera, related tasks of scene sampling 
update write_color function to handle multi sampled color computation 
    add full color each iteration, perform single divide at end by amount of samples when writing out color 

clamp(x, min, max): clamps value x to range [min, max]
