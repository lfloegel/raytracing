average of what camera sees over interval of shutter opening and shutting 
get random estimate by sending each ray at some random time when shutter is open 
    as long as objects where should be at that time, can get right average answer with a ray that is at exactly a 
    single time 
basic idea: generate rays at random time while shutter is open and intersect model at that one time 
    have camera move and objects move, but have rays exist at exactly one time 
        engine of ray tracer can make sure objects 


spacetime ray tracing: possibe to ray trace large animations more quickly in comparison to frame by frame rendering, 
reduces amount of ray object intersections that must be computed 
4D geometric space involving x, y, z and time 
each ray is a new way the camera sees the scene as the objects and camera moves and taking the average allows for 
motion blur effect 

modify camera to generate rays at random time between time1 and time2 
    should camera keep track of time1 and time2 or should it be left to user of camera when a ray is created 
    when in doubt, make constructor more complex if it makes calls simple 
    in book, camera keeps track - personal preference 
        camera right now does not move and generates rays over a time period 

need moving object: create sphere class that has its center move linearly from center0 at time0 to center1 at time1 
    keeps moving outside of time interval, so times need not match up with camera aperature open and close 
    alternative to making a new moving sphere class: make them all move while stationary spheres have same begin and 
    end position 
moving_sphere::hit() similar to sphere::hit(): center becomes a function center(time) 
    center of sphere keeps moving and need to update normal vectors with it 

motion image: takes diffuse spheres from scene and have them move during image render 
    each sphere moves from its center C at time t=0 to C + (0, r/2, 0) at time t=2 where r a random number in [0,1) 
    

acceleration structure: object that holds geometric info for primitives in the scene preprocessed in a way to allow 
trivial rejection of potential ray primitive intersections
