defocus blur: depth of field 
necessary in cameras as need big hole rather than a pinhole to gather light 
    defocuses everything 
    if stick lens in hole, certain distance where everything is in focus 
    lens: all light rays coming from a specific point and that hit the lens will be bent back to a single point on image 
    sensor 
focus distance: distance between projection point and plane where everything is in perfect focus 
focus length: distance between projection point and image plane 

in physical camera, focus distance controlled by distance between lens and film or sensor 
    reason why see lens move relative to camera when change what is in focus 
    aperature: hole to control how big lens is effectively 
        if need more light, need to make bigger aperature 
            will get more defocus blur 
    for virtual camera, can have perfect sensor and never need more light 
        only have aperature when want defocus blur 

simulate order: sensor, then lens, then aperature 
    then figure out where to send rays, flip image after it's computed 
        image projected upside down in film 
    graphcis usually uses thin lens approximation 
    no need to simulate inside of camera 
        unnecessary complexity for rendering image outside camera 
    start rays from lens, and send them toward focus plane or focus_dist away from lens where everything on plane in 
    focus 

normally all scene rays originate from lookfrom point 
    to accomplish defocus blur, generate random scene rays originating from inside a disk centered at lookfrom point 
    larger the radius, the greater the defocus blur 
    think of original camera as having defocus disk of radius zero so all rays originated at disk center lookfrom
