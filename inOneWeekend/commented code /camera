first allow an adjustable field of view 
    angle seen through the portal 
    as image not square, fov different horizontally and vertically 
    tend to use vertical fov 
    usually specify to degrees and change to radians in constructor - personal taste 

1. keep rays coming from origin and heading to z = -1 plane 
    can make it z = -2 plane or whatever as long as make h a ratio to that distance 
    h: height from z axis to ray 
        h = tan(Ø/2) 
        Ø: angle from ray above z axis to ray below z axis 

positioning and orienting camera: 
    to get arbitrary viewport, first name important points 
    1. call position to place camera lookfrom 
    2. call point looked at lookat
        can define a direction to look in instead 
    specify roll or sideways tilt of camera: rotation around lookat-lookfrom axis 
        need a way to specify an up vector for camera 
            up vector should lie in plane orthogonal to view direction 
        can use any up vector, and simply project it onto this plane to get up vector for camera 
        common convention of naming a view up 'vup' vector 
        use a couple of cross products for complete orthogonal basis (u, w, v) to desribe camera's orientation 
            vup, v, w all in same plane 
        arbitray view camera faces -w: axis direction towards lookat 
        can use world up (0, 1, 0) to specify up, not required 
            convinent and naturally keeps camera horizontally level until decide to experiment with crazy camera angles
