lighting key component of raytracing 
early simple raytracers used abstract light sources 
modern approaches use more physically based lights, which have position and size 
    need to be able to take any object and turn it into something that emits light into scene 

first make light emitting material 
    add emitted function 
        could add it to hit_record instead matter of design choice 
        tells ray what color it is and performs no reflection 
    to not make all non emitting materials implement emitted(), have base class return black 
want pure black backgorund so only light in scene coming from emitters 
    add background color paramter to ray_color function, and pay attention to new emitted value 
removing code used to determine color of sky when ray hit it 
    need to pass in new color for old scene renderers 
    could always pass in a boolean to swtich between previous skybox code versus new solid color background 

axis aligned rectangles easy 
rectangle in xy plane 
    plane defined by its z vlaue 
    i.e. z=k 
    axis aligned rectangle defined by lines x=x0, x=x1, y=y0 and y=y1 
to determine if ray hits rectangle, first determine where ray hits plane 
    ray P(t) = A + tb has z component defined by Pz(t) = A_z + tb_z 
    solve for t where z=k: 
        t = (k - A_z) / b_z 
    once t known, plug into equations for x and y: 
        x = A_x + tb_x 
        y = A_y + tb_y 
    hit if x0 < x < x1 and y0 < y < y1 
because rectangles axis aligned, their bounding boxes will have an infinitely thin side 
    problem when dividing them up with axis aligned bounding heirarchy 
    to counter, all hittable objects should get bundary box that has finite width along every dimension 
        for rectangles, pad box a bit on infinitely thin side 


set up rectangle as light 
in light image, light brither than (1, 1, 1), allows it to be bright enough to light things 

add in two other axes xy and yz and cornell box 
cornell box: introduced in 1984 
    models interaction of light between diffuse surfaces 
make five walls and light of box 

cornell image noisy as light is small
