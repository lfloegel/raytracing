volumes, participating media: smoke, fog, and mist 
subsurface scattering: dense fog inside object 
usually adds software architectural mayhem because volumes different animal than surfaces 
    cute technique to make volume a random surface 
    bunch of smoke can be replaced with surface probabilistically might or might not be there at every point in 
    volume 
volume of constant medium: ray through there can either scatter inside volume, or make it all the way through 
    more thin transparent volumes more likely to have rays go through 
        i.e. light fog 
    how far ray has to travel through volume determines how likely for ray to make it through 
    as ray passes through, may scatter at any point 
        denser the volume, more likely that is 
        probability ray scatters in any small distance L: 
            probability = C * L 
            C: proportional to optical density of volume 
    if go through all differential equations, for a random number get a distance where scattering occurs 
        if distance outside volume, no hit 
    for constant volume, need density C and boundary 

scattering function of isotropic picks uniform random direction 
make sure it works for ray origins inside volume 
    in clouds, things bounce a lot so that is a common case 
code assumes once ray exits constant medium boundary, will keep going infinitely outside boundary 
    assumes boundary shape convex 
    particular implementation works well for boundaries like boxes and spheres, not with toruses or shapes that 
    contain voids 

replace two boxes with smoke and fog make light bigger for faster convergence and dimmer so it doesn't blow out 
the scene 
    i.e. dark and light particles 

no shadow rays, but get caustic and subsurfaces for free 
    double edge design decision
