dielectrics: clear water and glass 
    when light ray hits surface, splits into reflected ray and refracted trasnmitted ray 
    handle by randomly choosing between reflection or refraction and generating only one scattered ray per interaction 

usually first have ll light refract if there is a refraction ray at all 
    book printed ray straight through middle of image 
        clearly wrong 

snell's law: ñ * sinØ = sinØ' * ñ' 
    Ø, Ø': angles from normal 
    eta, eta': refractive indices 
        i.e. air = 1.0, glass = 1.3 - 1.7, diamond = 2.4  
    describes refraction 
determine direction of refraction ray, solve for sinØ': sinØ' = eta/eta' * sinØ 
on refracted side of surface: 
    refracted ray R' 
    normal n' 
    angle Ø' between them 

    split R' into parts of the ray: 
        R' = R' perp + R' parallel 
    solve for both: 
        R' perp = eta/eta' (R + cosØn) 
        R' parallel = -sqrt(1 - |R' perp|^2)n
    solve for cosØ: 
        dot product of two vectors = cosine angle between them: a * b = |a||b|cosØ 
        restrict a, b to be unit vectors: a * b = cosØ 
        rewrite R' perp in terms of known quantities: 
            R' perp = eta/eta' (R + (-R * n)n) 
            -R as ray headed towards surface 

refract image produces glass sphere that always refracts 
issue: when ray in material with higher refractive index, no real solution to Snell's law and no refraction possible 
    i.e. if ray inside glass eta = 1.5 and outside is air eta' = 1.0: sinØ' = 1.5/1.0 * sinØ 
            value of sinØ' cannot be greater than 1 
            if 1.5/1.0 * sinØ > 1.0 
                equality between two sides of equation broken, solution cannot exist 
                if solution doesnt exist, glass cannot refract and must reflect ray 

total internal reflection: all light reflected usually inside solid objects 
    i.e. sometimes why water air boundary acts as perfect mirror when submerged 

sinØ = sqrt(1 - cos^2Ø) 
cosØ = R * n, - R in book equation as towards surface 

attenuation always 1 for glasss as absorbs nothing 

reflect image scene with dielectric and shiny sphere 
    glass sphere that sometimes refract 
    changed fuzziness of metal sphere to 0.0 

as light rays pass from one transparent medium to another, they change direction 
for fixed angle of incidence, amount of bending depends on index of refraction 
as light travels through another medium, speed decreases 

real glass has reflectivity that varies with angle 
deep complex equation for that, but usually use a much simpler one by Christopher Schlick 

if use - radius with dielectric spheres, geometry unaffected but surface normal points inwards 
    can be used as a bubble to make a hollow glass sphere
