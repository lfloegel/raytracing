procedural objects: geometry and material linked 

most ray traces mix and match 
    i.e. assign a material to multiple spheres and vice versa 

diffuse objects that dont emit light take on color of surroundings 
    modulate that with own intrinsic color 
light reflecting off diffuse surface has direction randomized 
    might be absorbed rather than reflected 
    darker the surface, more likely light absorbed 
        reasons why it is dark 
any algorithm that radomizes directions will produce matter surfaces 

two unit radius spheres tangent to hit point p of surface 
spheres have centers (P + n) and (P - n) 
    n: normal of surface 
    sphere with center (P - n): inside surface 
    sphere with center (P + n): outside surface 
select tangent unit radius sphere on same side of surface as ray origin 
pick random point S inside unit radius sphere, send a ray from point P to S 
    vector (S - P) 
    use rejection method 
        pick random point in unit cube where -1 <= x, y, z <= 1 
        reject point and try again if point outside sphere 

first diffuse image: 
    sphere only absorbs half of light energy on each bounce 
        50% reflectors 
    image viewers assume image is gamma corrected 
        0 to 1 values have some transform before being stored as a byte 
        gamma 2: raising color to power 1/gamma, 1/2 for book 

shadow acne problem: some reflected rays hit object reflecting off of not exactly at t=0, but instead ta t=-0.0000001 
or t=0.0000001 
    need to ignore hits very close to zero 
    tmin = 0.001 
    tmin < t < tmax 

rejection method: produces random points in unit ball offset along surface normal 
    correspond to picking directions on hemisphere with high probability close to normal and low probility of scattering 
    rays at grazing angles 
        distribution scales by cos^3Ø 
        Ø: angle from normal 
        useful as light arriving at shallow angles spread over a larger area 
            lower contribution to final color 

???? 
Lambertian distribution: distribution of cosØ 
    true lambertian has probability higher for ray scattering close to normal 
        distribution more uniform 
        pick points on surface of unit sphere, offset along surface normal 
        pick points on sphere by picking points in unit ball, then normalizing them 
    surface color of lambertian surface same regardless of viewing angle 

lambertian image: more uniform scattering of light rays, fewer rays scattered toward the normal 
    diffuse objects appear lighter as more light bounces towards the camera 
    shadows: less light bounces straight up, parts of larger sphere directly underneath smaller sphere are brighter 

difficult to mathematically prove that the probability distribution is correct 
difficult to intuitively explain why a cosØ distribution is desirable and what it would look like 

method described: 
    1. had a random vector 
        a. one of random length 
        b. then one of unit legnth 
    2. offset from hit point by normal 

more intuitive approach: have a uniform scatter direction for all angles from hit point 
    no dependence on angel from normal 
    many first ray tracers used this diffuse method before adopting Lambetian diffuse
