used pdf related to cos(Ã˜), and pdf related to sampling light 
    would like pdf that combines these 
any weighted averages of pdfs is a pdf 
    i.e. average of two densities: mixture_pdf(direction) = 1/2reflection_pdf(direction) + 1/2light_pdf(direction) 
choosing random direction: 
    if (random_double() < 0.5) 
        pick direction according to pdf_reflection 
    else 
        pick direction according to pdf_light 
evaluating mixture_pdf: evaluate both reflection_pdf and light_pdf because some directions either pdf could have generated 
    i.e. might generate a direction toward light using reflection_pdf 
two functions pdf needs to support: 
    1. what is value at the location? 
    2. return random number distributed appropriately 
densities image refactors where pdf computed 
    cosine density pdf 

try sampling directions toward a hittable  
    i.e. light
