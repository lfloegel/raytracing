problem with sampling almost uniformly over directions: lights not sampled any more than unimportant directions 
could use shadow rays and separate out direct lighting 
instead, send more rays to light 
    can use later to send more rays in whatever desired direction 

for light of area A, if sample uniformly on that light, pdf on surface of light is 1/A 
what is it on area of unit sphere that defines directions? 
look at small area dA on light, probability of sampling it is p_q(q) * dA 
on sphere, probability of sampling small area dw is p(direction) * dw 
geometric relationship: 
    dw = dA * cos(alpha) / distance^2(p,q) 
    p: point on surface 
    q: point on light 
probability of sampling dw and dA must be same: 
    p(direction) * (dA * cos(alpha) / distance^2(p,q)) = p_q(q) * dA = dA / A 
    p(direction) = distance^2(p,q) / cos(alpha) * A 

hack ray_color() to sample light in very hard coded fashion 
samples only light sources 

noisy pops around light on ceiling are because light two sided and small space between light and ceiling 
want to have light emit only down 
let emitted member function of hittable take extra info 
flip light so its normals point in - y direction 
    downwards
