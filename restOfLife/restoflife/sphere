in ray tracer picked random directions, and directions can be represented as points on unit sphere 
    need to have pdf defined over 2d 
suppose have integral over all directions: cos^2(Ø) 
    by mc integration, should be able to sample cos^2(Ø)/p(direction) 
        what is direction in that context 
        could make it based on polar coordinates 
            p in terms of (Ø,ø) 
        however done, pdf has to integrate to 1 and represent relative probability of that direction being sampled 
vec3 random_unit_vector() 
vec3 random_in_unit_sphere() 
    uniform random samples in or on unity sphere 
pdf of uniform points: 1/area of sphere or 1/(4pi) 
    density on unit sphere 
    if integrand cos^2(Ø), and Ø angle with z axis 
all integrals and proability over unit sphere 
    area on unit sphere how to measure directions 
        directions, solid angle, area all same thing 
        solid angle w and projected area A on unity sphere same thing
